# Multithreaded Data Processor
This project explores many of the built-in thread synchronization objects and utilities in C++ 17/ C++ 20, including std::thread, std::condition_variable, std::mutex, std::atomic, std::atomic::wait, std::async, std::future, std::for_each with execution_policy, and more. 

## Benchmarks
Multiple execution methods including sequential, parallel, std::for_each, std::async are bnechmarked to see which is the fastest and to demonstrate they are all working correctly.

### Unit Testing
- Unit testing is done using Google Test.

### Tooling
